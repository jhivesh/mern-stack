MongoDB, Express, React, Node js

Part 1: In this part, we want to complete the server-side work. We’ll work with Node and Express and connect it with MongoDB. After that, we’ll create some APIs.

Part 2: In the next section, we will focus on the frontend part with React to build our user interfaces. After that, we will connect our frontend to our backend.
